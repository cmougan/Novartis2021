## Scripts to generate features 

To generate features for 011_quantile_regressor we need to run:
* `split.csv`: This should be obtained from google drive, there is a script in the github history but I deleted it because @carlos was using it dangerously.
* `activity_features.csv`: Run features/activity_features.py
* `rte_basic_features.csv`: Run features/rte_basic_features.py. Currently this writes a file named rte_features_v2.csv, we should rename it to rte_basic_features.csv. If we want to obtain the basic features, we should go back to github history and run the script, as rte_features_v2.csv contains more features than the basic one.
* `market_size.csv`: This should be obtained from drive (it's actually not needed, so feel free to delete all its appearances), it was generated from @marc by debugging the metric script. 
* `brand_3_12_market_features_lagged.csv`: We should run features/brand_3_12_lags.py. However, this depends on the file data/features/brand_3_12_market_features.csv that was generated by either @marc or @carlos and I have no idea on how it was generated.
